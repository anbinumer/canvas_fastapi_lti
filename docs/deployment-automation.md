        ALERTS_SENT=$((ALERTS_SENT + 1))
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Health check failed (alert #$ALERTS_SENT)"
        
        if [ $ALERTS_SENT -ge 3 ]; then
            echo "üö® Multiple health check failures - considering rollback"
            # Add alerting logic here (Slack, email, etc.)
        fi
    else
        ALERTS_SENT=0  # Reset alert counter on successful check
        echo "‚úÖ Health check passed"
    fi
    
    sleep 30
done

echo "üìä Monitoring completed for $ENVIRONMENT"
```

### Log Monitoring

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# monitor-logs.sh - Monitor application logs for errors

ENVIRONMENT=${1:-production}

echo "üìú Monitoring logs for $ENVIRONMENT..."

# Stream Railway logs and monitor for errors
railway logs --environment $ENVIRONMENT --follow | while read line; do
    # Check for error patterns
    if echo "$line" | grep -i "error\|exception\|failed\|timeout"; then
        echo "üö® Error detected: $line"
        # Add alerting logic here
    fi
    
    # Check for Canvas API errors
    if echo "$line" | grep -i "canvas.*error\|rate.limit\|unauthorized"; then
        echo "üé® Canvas API issue: $line"
        # Add Canvas-specific alerting
    fi
done
```

```

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup

1. **Configure Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   ```

2. **Set up environments**:
   ```bash
   # Create or link Railway project
   railway init
   
   # Configure environments
   railway environment create test
   railway environment create beta
   railway environment create production
   ```

3. **Configure secrets**:
   ```bash
   # Set secrets for each environment
   railway environment test
   railway variables set CANVAS_TEST_CLIENT_ID="your_test_client_id"
   railway variables set CANVAS_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY="your_test_private_key"
   
   railway environment production
   railway variables set CANVAS_PROD_CLIENT_ID="your_prod_client_id"
   railway variables set CANVAS_PROD_PRIVATE_KEY="your_prod_private_key"
   ```

### Daily Operations

1. **Deploy to Test**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-test.sh
   ```

2. **Promote to Beta**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-beta.sh
   ```

3. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-production.sh
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh production 300
   ```

5. **Emergency Rollback**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh production
   ```

## Best Practices

### Deployment Safety
- Always validate test environment before promoting
- Use progressive deployment with health checks
- Maintain deployment backup points
- Monitor for 10+ minutes after production deployment

### Rollback Strategy
- Automated rollback on health check failures
- Manual rollback procedures documented
- Emergency rollback for critical issues
- Rollback validation required

### Monitoring
- Continuous health monitoring
- Canvas API connectivity monitoring
- Performance metric tracking
- Error rate alerting

This deployment automation framework ensures safe, reliable deployments of the Canvas QA Automation Tool across all environments while providing robust rollback capabilities and comprehensive monitoring.
