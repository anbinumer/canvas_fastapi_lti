### Railway Deployment Configuration
[Source: architecture.md#railway-service-configuration]

**Required railway.toml:**
```yaml
[build]
  builder = "nixpacks"
  buildCommand = "pip install -r requirements.txt"

[deploy]
  startCommand = "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
  healthcheckPath = "/health"
  healthcheckTimeout = 300
  restartPolicyType = "on-failure"
  restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

[environments.production]
  variables = { ENVIRONMENT = "production" }

[environments.staging]  
  variables = { ENVIRONMENT = "staging" }

[environments.development]
  variables = { ENVIRONMENT = "development" }
```

### Environment Configuration System
[Source: architecture.md#environment-management]

**Required Environment Configuration Pattern:**
```python
class EnvironmentConfig:
    """Environment-specific configuration for Railway deployment"""
    
    def get_environment_config(self) -> dict:
        configs = {
            'development': {
                'debug': True,
                'log_level': 'DEBUG',
                'canvas_api_timeout': 30,
                'max_concurrent_tasks': 5,
                'cache_ttl': 300,
                'session_timeout': 3600,
                'allowed_canvas_instances': ['canvas.test.instructure.com']
            },
            'production': {
                'debug': False,
                'log_level': 'WARNING',
                'canvas_api_timeout': 120,
                'max_concurrent_tasks': 25,
                'cache_ttl': 3600,
                'session_timeout': 14400,
                'allowed_canvas_instances': ['acu.instructure.com']
            }
        }
        return configs.get(self.environment, configs['development'])
```

### Basic Health Check Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#railway-monitoring]

**Health Check Endpoint Pattern:**
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Railway health check endpoint"""
    try:
        # Basic health verification
        return {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": datetime.utcnow()}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(503, f"Health check failed: {str(e)}")
```

### Testing Setup Requirements

## Notes

This story establishes the foundational FastAPI project with the exact structure and configuration specified in the architecture document. The implementation must follow the defined patterns to ensure compatibility with future Canvas LTI integration and QA framework development.

All file paths and configurations are derived from the architecture document to ensure consistency with the overall system design.
