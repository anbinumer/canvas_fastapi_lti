    constructor() {
        this.taskRegistry = new QATaskRegistry();
        this.progressTracker = new ProgressTracker();
        this.resultsDisplay = new ResultsDisplay();
        this.webSocketManager = new WebSocketManager();
    }
    
    async loadAvailableTasks() {
        // Fetch available QA tasks from API
        // Populate task selection interface
    }
    
    async startQATask(taskConfig) {
        // Validate configuration
        // Start task execution
        // Initialize progress tracking
    }
}
```

### URL Mapping Configuration Interface
```html
<!-- Dynamic URL Mapping Form -->
<div class="qa-url-mapping-config">
    <div class="mapping-header">
        <h3>URL Find & Replace Configuration</h3>
        <button class="add-mapping-btn" onclick="addURLMapping()">
            <i class="icon-plus"></i> Add URL Mapping
        </button>
    </div>
    
    <div id="url-mappings-container">
        <!-- Dynamic URL mapping pairs -->
    </div>
    
    <div class="configuration-options">

</div>
```

### Results Dashboard Design
```css
/* ACU-branded results styling */
.qa-results-dashboard {
    --acu-primary: #0066cc;
    --acu-secondary: #004d99;
    --acu-success: #28a745;
    --acu-warning: #ffc107;
    --acu-error: #dc3545;
}

.results-summary {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    gap: 1.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
}

.results-detail {
    background: white;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    border-left: 4px solid var(--acu-primary);
}
```

### WebSocket Progress Integration
```javascript
class ProgressTracker {
    constructor(taskId, userId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
        this.userId = userId;
        this.websocket = null;
        this.reconnectAttempts = 0;
        this.maxReconnectAttempts = 5;
    }
    
    async connect() {
        const wsUrl = `ws://localhost:8000/ws/qa/progress/${this.userId}`;
        this.websocket = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
        
        this.websocket.onmessage = (event) => {
            const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
            this.updateProgressDisplay(data);
        };
        
        this.websocket.onclose = () => {
            this.handleDisconnection();
        };
    }
    
    updateProgressDisplay(progressData) {
        // Update progress bar, stage information, ETA
        // Handle different progress message types
        // Trigger UI updates for completion or errors
    }
}
```

### Export Functionality Design
```javascript
class ExportManager {
    async generatePDFReport(taskResults) {
        // Generate ACU-branded PDF with comprehensive results
        // Include executive summary, detailed findings, recommendations
        // Add charts and visualizations for key metrics
    }
    
    async exportToCSV(taskResults) {
        // Create detailed CSV with all findings and metadata
        // Include timestamps, before/after URLs, processing details
        // Format for analysis in Excel or other tools
    }
    
    async shareWithinCanvas(reportData) {
        // Integrate with Canvas sharing capabilities
        // Create shareable links or direct Canvas notifications
        // Maintain proper Canvas security and permissions
    }
}
```
