## Dev Notes

### Canvas API Production Constraints
[Source: Canvas API Documentation & prd.md]

**Rate Limiting Implementation:**
```python
class ProductionCanvasRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self):
        # Canvas enforces 200 requests/minute per token
        # We implement 180/minute (90% capacity) for safety
        self.requests_per_minute = 180
        self.requests_per_hour = 4800  # 80% of Canvas 6000/hour limit
        self.burst_allowance = 10  # Allow brief bursts
        
    async def wait_for_availability(self):
        # Implement token bucket algorithm with Redis backing
        # Track per-user and global rate limits
        # Include safety margins for Canvas infrastructure load
```

**Canvas API Error Classification:**
- **Transient Errors:** Network timeouts, 502/503 errors → Retry with backoff
- **Rate Limiting:** 429 Too Many Requests → Wait and retry
- **Authentication:** 401 Unauthorized → Token refresh or re-authentication
- **Permission Errors:** 403 Forbidden → Log and report to user
- **Data Errors:** 404 Not Found → Skip item and continue processing
- **Server Errors:** 500 Internal Server Error → Retry with extended backoff

### Performance Optimization Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#performance-requirements]

**Large Course Handling:**
```python
class OptimizedQAProcessor:
    async def process_large_course(self, course_id: str, content_limit: int = 1000):
        # Batch processing in chunks of 50 items
        # Parallel processing with concurrency limits
        # Memory-efficient streaming of results
        # Progressive result storage to prevent data loss
        
    async def optimize_api_calls(self):
        # Combine multiple content requests where possible
        # Use Canvas API compound requests
        # Implement intelligent prefetching
        # Cache frequently accessed course metadata
```

**WebSocket Optimization:**
```python
class OptimizedProgressTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        # Throttle progress updates to max 2/second
        # Batch multiple updates into single messages
        # Implement client-side interpolation for smooth progress
        # Use compression for large result sets
```

### User Acceptance Testing Strategy
[Source: prd.md#success-metrics]

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Small Course Test:** 10-50 content items, basic URL replacements
2. **Medium Course Test:** 100-300 items, multiple content types
3. **Large Course Test:** 500+ items, complex replacement patterns
4. **Edge Case Testing:** Special characters, internationalization, broken content
