## Technical Architecture Preview

### **QA Task Framework Pattern**

```python
# Abstract base class for all QA tasks
class QATask(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, config: TaskConfig, progress_tracker: ProgressTracker) -> QAResult:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_task_info(self) -> TaskInfo:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def validate_config(self, config: TaskConfig) -> ValidationResult:
        pass

# Find & Replace implementation
class FindReplaceQATask(QATask):
    async def execute(self, config: FindReplaceConfig, progress_tracker: ProgressTracker) -> QAResult:
        # Canvas API scanning with progress updates
        # URL replacement detection and reporting
        # Results compilation with ACU formatting
```

### **Canvas API Integration**

```python
# Canvas service with rate limiting
class CanvasService:
    async def scan_course_content(self, course_id: str, progress_callback: Callable):
        # Rate limited API calls (200/min, 5000/hour)
        # Real-time progress updates
        # Error handling and retry logic
        # Session token management
```

### **User Interface Flow**

```
LTI Dashboard → Task Selection → URL Mapping → Execute → Progress → Results → Export
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓         ↓         ↓        ↓
Story 1.3      Story 2.3     Story 2.3   Story 2.2  Story 2.1  Story 2.3  Story 2.3
```
